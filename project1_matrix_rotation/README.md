# 6172 Project 1: Fast Matrix Rotation
This program rotates images by 90 degrees using an efficient O(n^2) algorithm.

## Get Started
```
cd snailspeed
make
./rotate -t file -f img/speedlimit.bmp -o img/rotated_speedlimit.bmp
```
- see help in `./rotate` for more ways to test
- Note: `tiers` only test speed of your code but not correctness. If you want to test for correctness, please use `correctness` option.
